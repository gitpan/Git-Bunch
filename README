NAME
    Git::Bunch - Manage gitbunch directory (directory which contain git
    repos)

VERSION
    version 0.22

SYNOPSIS
    To check the status of bunch (will do a 'git status' for each git repo
    inside the bunch and report which repos are 'unclean', e.g. needs
    commit, has untracked files, etc):

     % gitbunch check ~/repos

    To synchronize bunch to another (will do a 'git pull/push' for each git
    repo, and do an rsync for everything else):

     % gitbunch sync ~/repos /mnt/laptop/repos

    To backup bunch (will only rsync .git/ for each git repo to destination,
    and rsync everything else in full):

     % gitbunch backup ~/repos /media/flashdisk

DESCRIPTION
    A gitbunch or bunch directory is just a term I coined to refer to a
    directory which contains, well, a bunch of git repositories. It can also
    contain other stuffs like files and non-git repositories (but they must
    be dot-dirs). Example:

     repos/            -> a gitbunch dir
       proj1/          -> a git repo
       proj2/          -> ditto
       perl-Git-Bunch/ -> ditto
       ...
       .foo/           -> a non-git dir
       README.txt      -> file

    A little bit of history: after git got popular, in 2008 I started using
    it for software projects, replacing Subversion and Bazaar. Soon, I moved
    everything to git: notes & writings, Emacs .org agenda files,
    configuration, even temporary downloads/browser-saved HTML files.
    Currently, except large media files, all my personal data resides in git
    repositories. I put them all in ~/repos (and add symlinks to various
    places for convenience). This setup makes it easy to sync to laptops,
    backup to disk, etc. Git::Bunch is the library/script I wrote to do
    this.

    See also File::RsyBak, which I wrote to backup everything else.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.

FAQ
